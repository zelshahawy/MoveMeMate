Before getting into the specifics, however, we woul d like to stress the importance of proper documenta tion. Many taxpayers forgo worthwhile tax deductions because t hey have neglected to keep receipts or records. Kee ping adequate records is required by the IRS for employe e business expenses, deductible travel and entertai nment expenses, and charitable gifts and travel. But don' t do it just because the IRS says so. Neglecting to track these deductions can lead to overlooking them. You also n eed to maintain records regarding your income. If y our receive a large tax-free amount, such as a gift or inheritance, make certain to document the item so t hat the IRS does not later claim that you had unreported income . The checklist items listed below are for general in formation only and should be tailored to your speci fic situation. If you think one of them fits your tax situation, we'd be happy to discuss it with you. Avoid or Defer Income Recognition Deferring taxable income makes sense for two reason s. Most individuals are in a higher tax bracket in their working years than they are during retirement. Defe rring income until retirement may result in paying taxes on that income at a lower rate. Additionally, through the u se of tax-deferred retirement accounts you can actu ally invest the money you would have otherwise paid in taxes to increase the amount of your retirement fund. Defer ral can also work in the short term if you expect to be in a lower bracket in the following year or if you can take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates by holding a n asset a little longer. Tip: You can achieve the same effect of deferring incom e by accelerating deductions, for example, by payin g a state estimated tax installment in December instead of at the following January due date. Max Out Your 401(k) or Similar Employer Plan Many employers offer plans where you can elect to d efer a portion of your salary and contribute it to a tax- deferred retirement account. For most companies the se are referred to as 401(k) plans. For many other employers, such as universities, a similar plan cal led a 403(b) is available. Check with your employer about the availability of such a plan and contribute as much as possible to defer income and accumulate retireme nt assets. Tip: Some employers match a portion of employee contrib utions to such plans. If this is available, you sho uld structure your contributions to receive the maximum employer matching contribution. If You Have Your Own Business, Set Up and Contribut e to a Retirement Plan If you have your own business, consider setting up and contributing as much as possible to a retiremen t plan. These are allowed even for sideline or moonlighting businesses. Several types of plans are available w hich minimize the paperwork involved in establishing and administering such a plan. Related Guide: For details on Keogh plans and other retirement pl ans benefiting self-employed owners, see the Financial Guide: EMPLOYEE BENEFITS: How To Handle Them. Contribute to an IRA If you have income from wages or self-employment in come, you can build tax-sheltered investments by contributing to a traditional or a Roth IRA. You ma y also be able to contribute to a spousal IRA -even where the spouse has little or no earned income. All IRAs def er the taxation of IRA investment income and in som e cases can be deductible or be withdrawn tax free. Related Guide: For details on how Roth IRAs work and how they com pare in other respects with traditional IRAs, please see the Financial Gui de: ROTH IRAs: How They Work and How To Use Them. Related Guide: For details on the Coverdell Education Savings Acc ount (formerly the Education IRA) - special purpose vehicles for higher education - please see the Financial Guide: HIGHER EDUCATION COSTS: How To Get The Maximum Deduction. Tip: To get the most from IRA contributions, fund the I RA as early as possible in the year. Also, pay the IRA trustee out of separate funds, not out of the amoun t in the IRA. Following these two rules will ensure that you get the most possible tax-deferred earnings from your m oney. Defer Bonuses or Other Earned Income If you are due a bonus at year-end, you may be able to defer receipt of these funds until January. Thi s can defer the payment of taxes (other than the portion withhe ld) for another year. If you're self employed, defe r sending invoices or bills to clients or customers until aft er the new year begins. Here, too, you can defer so me of the tax, subject to estimated tax requirements. This may eve n save taxes if you are in a lower tax bracket in t he following year. Note, however, that the amount subject to soc ial security or self-employment tax increases each year. Accelerate Capital Losses and Defer Capital Gains If you have investments on which you have an accumu lated loss, it may be advantageous to sell it prior to year- end. Capital losses are deductible up to the amount of your capital gains plus $3,000. If you are plan ning on selling an investment on which you have an accumula ted gain, it may be best to wait until after the en d of the year to defer payment of the taxes for another year (sub ject to estimated tax requirements). For most capit al assets held more than 12 months (long-term capital gains) the maximum capital gains tax is 15 percent, but is set to expire at the end of 2012. However, make sure to co nsider the investment potential of the asset. It ma y be wise to hold or sell the asset to maximize the economic gai n or minimize the economic loss. Watch Trading Activity In Your Portfolio When your mutual fund manager sells stock at a gain , these gains pass through to you as realized taxab le gains, even though you don't withdraw them. So you may pre fer a fund with low turnover, assuming satisfactory investment management. Turnover isn't a tax conside ration in tax-sheltered funds such as IRAs or 401(k )s. For growth stocks you invest in directly and hold for t he long term, you pay no tax on the appreciation un til you sell them. No capital gains tax is imposed on appreciati on at your death. Use the Gift-Tax Exclusion to Shift Income You can give away $13,000 ($26,000 if joined by a s pouse) per donee in 2012 (same as 2011), per year w ithout paying federal gift tax. You can give $13,000 to as many donees as you like. The income on these trans fers will then be taxed at the donee's tax rate, which is in many cases lower. Note: Special rules apply to children under age 18. Also , if you directly pay the medical or educational ex penses of the donee, such gifts will not be subject to gif t tax. Invest in Treasury Securities For high-income taxpayers, who live in high-income- tax states, investing in Treasury bills, bonds, and notes can pay off in tax savings. The interest on Treasuries is exempt from state and local income tax. Also, in vesting in Treasury bills that mature in the next tax year res ults in a deferral of the tax until the next year. Consider Tax-Exempt Municipal Bonds Interest on state or local municipal bonds is gener ally exempt from federal income tax and from tax by the issuing state or locality. For that reason, interest paid o n such bonds is somewhat less than that paid on com mercial bonds of comparable quality. However, for individua ls in higher brackets, the interest from municipal bonds will often be greater than from higher paying commercial bonds after reduction for taxes. Gain on sale of m unicipal bonds is taxable and loss is deductible. Tax-exempt interest is sometimes an element in computation of other tax items. Interest on loans to buy or carry tax-exempt s is non-deductible. Give Appreciated Assets to Charity If you're planning to make a charitable gift, it ge nerally makes more sense to give appreciated long-t erm capital assets to the charity, instead of selling the asset s and giving the charity the after-tax proceeds. Do nating the assets instead of the cash prevents your having to pay capital gains tax on the sale, which can result in considerable savings, depending on your tax bracket and the amount of tax that would be due on the sal e. Additionally you can obtain a tax deduction for the fair market value of the property. Tip: Many taxpayers also give depreciated assets to cha rity. Deduction is for fair market value; no loss d eduction is allowed for depreciation in value of a personal asset. Depending on the item donated, there may be strict valuation rules and deduction limits. Keep Track of Mileage Driven for Business, Medical or Charitable Purposes If you drive your car for business, medical or char itable purposes, you may be entitled to a deduction for miles driven. For 2012, it's 55.5 cents per mile for busi ness, 23 cents for medical and moving purposes, and 14 cents for service for charitable organizations. You need to keep detailed daily records of the mileage drive n for these purposes to substantiate the deduction. Take Advantage of Your Employer's Benefit Plans to Get an Effective Deduction for Items Such as Medical Expenses Medical and dental expenses are generally only dedu ctible to the extent they exceed 7.5% of your adjus ted gross income (AGI). For most individuals, particularly th ose with high income, this eliminates the possibili ty for a deduction. You can effectively get a deduction for these items if your employer offers a Flexible Spen ding Account, sometimes called a cafeteria plan. These p lans permit you to redirect a portion of your salar y to pay these types of expenses with pre-tax dollars. Anoth er such arrangement is a Health Savings Account. As k your employer if they provide either of these plans. Check Out Separate Filing Status Certain married couples may benefit from filing sep arately instead of jointly. Consider filing separat ely if you meet the following criteria: \u2022 One spouse has large medical expenses, miscellaneou s itemized deductions, or casualty losses. \u2022 The spouses' incomes are about equal. Separate filing may benefit such couples because th e adjusted gross income \"floors\" for taking the lis ted deductions will be computed separately. On the othe r hand, some tax benefits are denied to couples fil ing separately. In some states, filing separately can a lso save a significant amount of state income taxes . If Self-Employed, Take Advantage of Special Deducti ons You may be able to expense up to $500,000 in 2012 f or qualified equipment purchases for use in your bu siness immediately instead of writing it off over many yea rs. Additionally, self-employed individuals can ded uct 100% of their health insurance premiums as business expense s. You may also be able to establish a Keogh, SEP o r SIMPLE plan, or a Health Savings Account, as mentio ned above. If Self-Employed, Hire Your Child in the Business If your child is under age 18, he or she is not sub ject to employment taxes from your unincorporated b usiness (income taxes still apply). This will reduce your i ncome for both income and employment tax purposes a nd shift assets to the child at the same time; however, you cannot hire your child if he or she in under the ag e of 8 years old. Take Out a Hom e-Equity Loan Most consumer related interest expense, such as fro m car loans or credit cards, is not deductible. Int erest on a home-equity loan, however, can be deductible. It ma y be advisable to take out a home-equity loan to pa y off other nondeductible obligations. Bunch Your Itemized Deductions Certain itemized deductions, such as medical or emp loyment related expenses, are only deductible if th ey exceed a certain amount. It may be advantageous to delay p ayments in one year and prepay them in the next yea r to bunch the expenses in one year. This way you stand a better chance of getting a deduction."}

{"text": "Income Tax Saving Strategies for Business Owners Bernstein Private Wealth Management 2A wide array of income tax saving options are available to business owners with the luxury and foresight to plan\u2014provided they know where to look. The optimal strategy depends not only on the business owner\u2019s goals and objectives, but on obtaining expert advice well before a deal is on the table. In part, the \u201cright\u201d approach depends on the circumstances. For instance, business owners who live in high-income-tax-rate states can avoid state tax by establishing a specialized trust in a jurisdiction with no income tax. What\u2019s more, business owners may sidestep $10 million or more of otherwise taxable gain for federal tax purposes (and potentially state income tax purposes as well1) if their ownership interest is qualified small business stock (QSBS) within the meaning of Section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code.2 In this paper, we\u2019ll explore both of these strategies in detail, as they tend to be underappreciated relative to their considerable tax-saving potential. 1 Not all states conform to Section 1202 which will still result in a state income tax liability on the sale of QSBS. As of this writing, California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Alabama, and Mississippi do not conform, while Hawaii and Massachusetts partially conform to Section 1202. 2 Within the meaning of Section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (hereinafter, \u201cIRC\u201d). Income Taxes: State of Play Before diving in, note that income tax rates differ substantially from state to state. Some states\u2014including Massachusetts, Utah, and Illinois\u2014levy a flat income tax while others\u2014Florida, Texas, and Nevada, for example\u2014impose no state income tax at all. New Jersey and California, among others, have marginal percentage rates in the double digits, while others set their taxes at quite modest levels, comparatively speaking ( Display 1 ). DISPLAY 1: STATE INCOME TAXES DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM STATE TO STATE Top Marginal State Individual Income Tax Rates (as of January 1, 2022) Note: Map shows top marginal rates: the maximum statutory rate in each state. This map does not show effective marginal tax rates, which would include the effects of phase-outs of various tax preferences. Local income taxes are not included. Missouri\u2019s top marginal rate will be reduced to 5.3% if certain revenue triggers are met. *State has flat income tax. **State only taxes interest and dividend income. Source: Bloomberg BNA; Tax Foundation; state tax statutes, forms, and constructions. To mitigate state income taxes, some entrepreneurs may consider relocating to a lower-tax state. But changing one\u2019s tax domicile can be complicated, and the requirements vary state-by-state. And another option\u2014qualified retirement plans or individual retirement accounts (IRAs)\u2014generally disallow ownership interests in one\u2019s closely held business.Instead, some entrepreneurs with deals in sight might consider an incomplete gift nongrantor (ING) trust. When properly implemented, this strategy eliminates state income taxes on sale proceeds, but it isn\u2019t for everyone. Ultimately, its appeal rests on careful structuring and a thorough understanding of the trade-offs. Let\u2019s explore in further detail. Bernstein Private Wealth Management 3 DINGs, WINGs, and NINGs Among the zero-income-tax states where an ING trust might be established are Delaware (DING), Nevada (NING), and Wyoming (WING). While these acronyms might sound like silverware hitting the floor, they\u2019re actually powerful tools for an eventual business exit. Whichever the jurisdiction, business owners can use these strategies to secure substantial state income tax savings\u2014provided the trust is properly structured.3 How do ING trusts work? First, a business owner living in a high-tax- rate state (other than New York4) establishes a nongrantor trust\u2014one that\u2019s treated as a separate taxpayer for income tax purposes\u2014in a state that does not tax the trust\u2019s retained income (e.g., Delaware, Nevada, Wyoming, Tennessee). Notably, the trust must have two essential features: \u2022The gift must be \u201cincomplete\u201d so that the entrepreneur is treated as owning the trust assets for estate and gift tax purposes, and \u2022The trust must be a \u201cnongrantor trust\u201d so that the entrepreneur isn\u2019t treated as owning the trust assets for income tax purposes. This combination allows the grantor to achieve a favorable state income tax outcome without making a taxable gift ( Display 2 ). DISPLAY 2: \u201cINCOMPLETE\u201d NONGRANTOR (ING) TRUSTS HINGE ON WHAT YOU OWN \u201cIncomplete\u201d Grantor owns trust assets for estate and gift tax purposes \u201cNongrantor\u201d Grantor doesn\u2019t own trust assets for income tax purposes Trust Powers: Knowing When to Hold or Fold To ensure the transfer to the trust will be considered incomplete for gift tax purposes, the grantor must reserve sufficient power over the transferred assets. Typically, the grantor will retain a power to direct the trustee to distribute the trust\u2019s assets to others.5 If properly structured, the mere existence of this \u201climited power of appointment\u201d will make the grantor\u2019s gift to the trust incomplete. Relinquishment of the grantor\u2019s power of appointment would complete the gift; for that reason, in most cases, the power will remain in effect during the grantor\u2019s lifetime. For income tax purposes, limitations on the grantor\u2019s ability to receive distributions of trust assets help ensure qualification as a nongrantor trust.6 Among other provisions, the trust instrument typically will prohibit any distribution to the grantor without consent of a \u201cdistribution committee\u201d consisting of a subset of, or all, current beneficiaries. If the trust meets both requirements\u2014the gift to the trust is incomplete, but the trust is not a grantor trust\u2014then undistributed trust income should avoid state income tax, while distributed income will be subject to income tax in the beneficiary\u2019s home state. Either way, an ING trust is still subject to federal income tax (whether income is accumulated in the trust or distributed to beneficiaries). And, if income is accumulated, the trust must pay those federal income taxes under highly compressed trust tax brackets. Bernstein Private Wealth Management 43 Trust income tax laws vary from state to state, so state income tax savings may not be achieved in every situation. For example, some states assert the right to tax a trust forever if the grantor was a resident of that state at the time the trust became irrevocable. 4 New York treats an ING trust established by a resident as a grantor trust for state income tax purposes; other states, including California, are considering similar legislation. 5 Treas. Reg. Sec. 25.251 1-2(b). 6 See Sections 671-679 of the Internal Revenue Code. Scenario A Scenario B Scenario C Scenario D Assumptions \u2022No tax planning prior to the sale \u2022One spouse gives $10 million of their business interest to an ING trust prior to the sale \u2022One spouse gives $10 million of their business interest to nongrantor trust, in a tax-favored state, prior to the sale as a completed gift \u2022One spouse gives $10 million of their business interest to a SLAT for the benefit of the other spouse and their descendants Strategy \u2022Sell the business for $30 million \u2022Pay a $9 million income tax liability* \u2022Reinvest the remaining $21 million in an 80%/20% portfolio of global stocks and bonds \u2022Riveras personally receive $14 million, net of federal, state, and local tax \u2022ING Trust receives $7.63 million, net of just federal tax\u2020 \u2022Saves $620,000 in state and local income taxes \u2022Riveras personally receive $14 million, net of federal, state, and local tax \u2022Nongrantor trust receives $7.63 million, net of just federal tax\u2020 \u2022Saves $620,000 in state and local income taxes \u2022Trust assets will be excluded from the Riveras\u2019 taxable estate as neither spouse is a beneficiary of the trust \u2022The SLAT essentially reverses the tax effects of the ING trust \u2022Grantor is treated as owner for federal, state, and local income tax purposes, but not for estate and gift tax purposes \u2022Riveras pay the entire $9 million tax liability from the sale \u2022Receive $1 1 million personally and $10 million in the SLAT *Taxes were calculated assuming all $30 million will be subject to a 30% tax rate (20% federal long-term capital gain plus a 10% state rate). As the Riveras were active owners, they were not subject to the 3.8% net investment income tax. \u2020As the trustee of the ING would not generally be an active owner of the business, we assumed that the proceeds the ING received would be subject to the 3.8% net investment income tax, in addition to a 20% long-term capital gains tax.Case Study: Exploring Exit Options Consider the Riveras, a 60-year-old couple planning to sell their business for $30 million. For our purposes, we\u2019ll assume they live in a (fictional) state that imposes an income tax at a flat rate of 10%. Like many entrepreneurs, most of their wealth is tied up in their business. However, they have set aside $2.5 million in marketable investments, including a $1.5 million retirement account. While they enjoy living in their current state, the prospect of losing 10% (i.e., $3 million) of their sale proceeds to state and local taxes concerns them. The Riveras want to maximize their after-tax proceeds since they\u2019ll rely on those funds to sustain their annual living expenses of $250,000, adjusted for inflation, over their lifetimes. Could an ING trust provide a meaningful tax benefit? Or would forgoing that income tax benefit and establishing a spousal lifetime access trust (SLAT) instead prove more effective? To answer these questions, let\u2019s analyze four different scenarios: The results of our model surprised the Riveras ( Display 3 ). They can clearly sustain their lifestyle for 30 years, but in the absence of any planning, will likely owe significant estate taxes at the second death (Scenario A). Giving $10 million to an ING (Scenario B) achieves a somewhat better outcome by generating an immediate state income tax savings of $620,000. But that extra savings increases the size of their taxable estate, which drives their future estate tax liability higher. Conversely, a $10 million completed gift to a non-ING trust (Scenario C) not only saves them $620,000 in income taxes but also removes future growth of the trust\u2019s assets from their estate for federal estate tax purposes. Bernstein Private Wealth Management 5 DISPLAY 3: THE NONGRANTOR TRUSTS CREATE AN IMMEDIATE INCOME TAX SAVINGS WHILE THE \u201cCOMPLETED\u201d GIFT AND SLAT CREATE ESTATE TAX SAVINGS Projected Wealth\u2014Year 30 (Nominal, USD Million)* Assuming Current Estate Tax Laws Out of Estate\u2013$13.9 \u2013$15.8\u2013$7.8$46.1 $19.0$27.0 $13.4$29.9$29.9 $46.2$48.9$56.9 $46.1$59.6 Estate Tax\u00a7ING or CNG\u2020SLAT\u2021 After-Tax EstateTotal Wealth Increase in Total Wealth$2.8 $10.8 $13.5Scenario A No PlanningScenario D $10 Mil.

All scenarios assume the assets are invested with an asset allocation of 80% global stocks and 20% bonds, and that all assets with the exception of the assets in the nongrantor trusts are subject to a state tax rate of 10%. Projections assumed the transaction was structured as a stock sale, not an asset sale, and that no state-sourced income from grantors home state was realized. \u2020Assumes $10 million is transferred to an \u201cincomplete\u201d nongrantor trust (ING) or a \u201ccompleted\u201d nongrantor trust (CNG). In both cases, the trust will be structured where it will only pay federal taxes on the income generated by the trust. The CNG is a completed gift and is out of the grantor\u2019s estate for estate tax purposes. \u2021The SLAT is assumed to be funded with $10 million and that the grantor will pay the taxes on the trust for the first 20 years of the analysis, thereafter the trust will pay its own taxes. \u00a7Estate taxes were calculated assuming a federal rate of 40% and that the lifetime exemption sunsets back to $6.03 million per person, adjusted for inflation. It is assumed that one spouse used $10 million of their lifetime exemption to make the completed gift or to fund the SLAT in scenarios C and D. The values do not account for any benefit from a step-up in cost basis. Projections based on AB\u2019s estimates of the range of returns for the applicable capital markets over the periods analyzed. Data do not represent past performance and are not a promise of actual future results or a range of future results. Bernstein does not provide tax or legal advice; investors should consult tax and legal professionals before making any decisions. See Notes on the Bernstein Wealth Forecasting System in Appendix for further details. Lastly, and perhaps unexpectedly, the SLAT (Scenario D) confers the greatest benefit of all: While the SLAT yields no income tax savings, the family\u2019s wealth is significantly enhanced by shifting federal, state, and local income taxes from the trust to the Riveras personally. This depletes their estate and, in this case, completely eliminates their potential estate tax liability. The savings is mainly due to the grantor\u2019s ability to pay the SLAT\u2019s income taxes without those payments being treated as additional gifts to the trust for federal gift tax purposes.7 Without this income tax burden, the SLAT accumulates $16.3 million more wealth than the taxable trusts (Scenarios B and C) over a 30-year period. All in all, the family is better off by $13.5 million (29% more wealth) after 30 years compared to the \u201cno planning\u201d scenario. Bernstein Private Wealth Management 67 Rev. Rul. 2004-64, 2004-2 C.B. 7, 2004. An Optimal Solution? In general, establishing an ING trust makes the most sense when the grantor: \u2022Lives in a high-income-tax-rate state; \u2022Is in the top-marginal-income-tax bracket for federal income tax purposes; \u2022Has already used her or his full federal gift and estate tax exclusion ($12.92 million in 2023); and \u2022Has appreciated assets (like business interests) to contribute that would benefit from a step-up in cost basis at the grantor\u2019s death. Before proceeding, there are several considerations that business owners and their professional advisors must weigh, including: 1. Availability : This strategy may not be legally available in the entrepreneur\u2019s state of residence. Some states assert the right to tax tangible assets (e.g., real estate, businesses), notwithstanding ownership by an out-of-state trust. As mentioned previously, at least one state (New York) treats an ING trust established by a resident as a grantor trust for state income tax purposes. Other states may follow. 2. Trade-Offs : As the case study shows, an ING trust can provide substantial income tax savings on an initial sale, but (i) will require the trust to be taxed at extremely condensed federal income tax brackets on undistributed income; and (ii) will not provide any estate tax relief. 3. Oversight : An ING trust requires an individual or corporate trustee domiciled in the tax-favored state. A corporate trustee charges administration fees, which must be factored into the strategy\u2019s net value. After sale of the business, the ING trust\u2019s future federal income taxes may be mitigated by (i) distributing, rather than retaining, trust accounting income; and (ii) adopting tax-efficient investment strategies, such as tax-loss harvesting, and \u201cwrapping\u201d high-returning, tax-inefficient investments in one or more low-cost private placement life insurance (PPLI) policies. QSBS Can Also Lead to Big Savings Most entrepreneurs\u2014whether they live in a high-state-income-tax- rate jurisdiction or not\u2014place a high priority on reducing the tax burden of an eventual business sale. Yet, tax planning prior to a business sale can be complicated. The more lead time owners have before closing, the more options they can preserve. Those who own stock in a closely held C corporation should determine, at a minimum, whether their ownership interest meets the statutory definition of QSBS under Section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code.Qualifying for QSBS: An \u201cExclusive\u201d Club For stock to be considered QSBS ( Display ), it must be or have been: 1.

Bernstein Private Wealth Management 8assets\u2014including any gain recognized on the sale of the business. As a result, the SLAT is not entitled to a separate $10 million QSBS exclusion. However, assets held in the SLAT will not be subject to estate tax at the grantor\u2019s death, and the continuing obligation to pay income taxes on behalf of the trust and its beneficiaries will deplete the Riveras\u2019 estate for estate tax purposes. Quantifying the Outcomes Upon seeing our analysis, the Riveras were taken aback when they compared the amount of sale proceeds subject to income tax under each scenario ( Display 4, top section of each bar). Scenario C, in particular, stood out. Multiplying the QSBS exclusion through nongrantor trusts provides immediate income tax savings on the sale\u2014 but Scenario C layered on an even more significant estate tax benefit by structuring the second nongrantor trust as a CNG trust. Essentially, by making both completed and incomplete gifts to nongrantor trusts, the couple can avoid all income tax arising from their exit.Even those with a working knowledge of QSBS may not fully appreciate its potential. For instance, with appropriate pre-transaction planning, exiting owners may qualify for additional $10 million exclusions. How? If a gift of QSBS is made to another taxpayer\u2014such as a family member or perhaps a nongrantor trust\u2014that stock retains its \u201coriginal issuance\u201d status and is therefore eligible for its own $10 million exclusion, assuming all other statutory requirements are met.8 As you are about to see, this ability to \u201cstack\u201d multiple QSBS exclusions can be a very powerful strategy. Multiplying the QSBS Exclusion Let\u2019s revisit the Riveras, who \u201cwinged\u201d their way to considerable state tax savings earlier. They still plan to sell their business for $30 million, but this time we\u2019ll assume their company was structured as a C corporation\u2014rather than a limited liability company taxable as a partnership\u2014when it was first established. As they contemplate their goals, the couple remains intent on securing $250,000 of annual, inflation-adjusted spending while minimizing income and estate taxes. Since the Riveras structured their business as a C corporation, held their shares for more than five years, and met all other requirements of Section 1202, their stock qualifies as QSBS. That means they can exclude $10 million of gain from the sale of their business, netting them $3.4 million9 in tax savings. Could they do better? Our analysis explores several scenarios: \u2022Scenario A : No additional planning; the Riveras exclude only $10 million of gain. \u2022Scenario B : The couple gives a $10 million stake in their business to an ING trust. As a separate taxpayer, the ING trust should be entitled to its own $10 million QSBS exclusion, saving an additional $3.4 million in income taxes. Yet the \u201cincomplete\u201d nature of the gift means that the assets held in trust will still be subject to estate tax at the grantor\u2019s death. \u2022Scenario C : Mirrors Scenario B, except prior to the sale, the couple also makes a \u201ccompleted\u201d gift of $10 million worth of shares in the business to a separate nongrantor (CNG) trust. This hybrid strategy should shield all $30 million of gain from income tax. In addition, assets held in the CNG trust at the grantor\u2019s death should avoid estate tax. \u2022Scenario D : Mirrors Scenario B, except the Riveras also give $10 million to a SLAT. Because a SLAT is almost always a grantor trust, the grantor must pay all income taxes attributable to the SLAT\u2019s 9 For purposes of this analysis, we assume that the Riveras reside in a state that conforms to IRC Section 1202 and that eligible gain avoids state income tax at a \u201cflat\u201d rate of 10%. 10 On several occasions, most recently in the Biden administration\u2019s \u201cgreenbook\u201d of Fiscal Year 2023 tax reform proposals, the Democrats have proposed to curtail or eliminate many of the estate planning benefits of grantor trusts, including, for example, a proposal to treat the grantor\u2019s payment of income taxes on behalf of the trust and its beneficiaries as taxable transfers for federal gift tax purposes. See Department of the Treasury, General Explanations of the Administration\u2019s Fiscal Year 2023 Revenue Proposals, at 42 (March 2022); cf. Rev. Rul. 2004-64, 2004-27 I.R.B. 7 (treating such payments as true obligations, not gifts).

In scenario C, we assumed the owners gave $10 million to a completed nongrantor trust (CNGT) that would receive its own $10 million exclusion. In scenario D, we assumed the $10 million gift to the SLAT would not receive any income tax benefit from the sale, but we assumed the grantor will pay taxes on the trust each year of the analysis from their assets and if depleted, then INGT. \u2020Estate taxes were calculated assuming a federal rate of 40% and that the lifetime exemption sunsets back to $6.03 million per person, adjusted for inflation.

Bernstein does not provide tax or legal advice; investors should consult tax and legal professionals before making any decisions. See Notes on the Bernstein Wealth Forecasting System in Appendix for further details.Did the SLAT (Scenario D) add any value? Perhaps surprisingly, not as much as the CNG trust ( Display 5). That\u2019s because a SLAT provides no separate QSBS benefit. And at $85.5 million, the net assets the couple would have accumulated in 30 years under Scenario C exceed the $82.0 million in the SLAT (Scenario D) by about 4%\u2014without having to rely on another three decades of favorable grantor trust laws.10CRUTs Help Overcome the Loss of Control Although the prospect of completely sidestepping income taxes appealed to the Riveras, they were uncomfortable making irrevocable gifts that could considerably restrict their use and enjoyment of the assets. Could these entrepreneurs capture an additional $10 million QSBS exclusion without forgoing future access? 11 The income tax charitable deduction is not the total amount contributed, but rather the present value of what is expected to pass to charity at the end of the noncharitable term of the trust. The present value calculation takes into account the value of the contributed assets, the discount rate (based on the applicable \u201cSection 7520 rate\u201d), and the noncharitable term of the trust (either a fixed term of years, or for lifetime trusts, a life expectancy table is used). See IRC \u00a7\u00a7 664, 7520, and the applicable Treasury regulations thereunder. Bernstein Private Wealth Management 10One potential solution may be contributing $10 million of shares to a charitable remainder unitrust (CRUT). In exchange, the couple would receive an upfront income tax charitable deduction for a portion of the value contributed.11 They would also retain the right to receive a fixed percentage of the fair market value of the CRUT\u2019s assets each year (a \u201cunitrust\u201d distribution) for a set term or for life. Since a CRUT is tax-exempt, the sale proceeds should not be taxed immediately. Instead, periodic distributions will be taxed to the Riveras based on certain \u201ctiered\u201d rules of accounting12 where the highest-taxed tranches are deemed to be paid out first. If the CRUT qualifies for a separate QSBS exclusion, $10 million of gain should avoid taxation. On the other hand, if the CRUT is not treated as a separate taxpayer for QSBS purposes, then that $10 million of deferred gain will be taxable to the Riveras over the noncharitable term, which could stretch over their joint lifetimes. This sounded compelling to the Riveras. They would retain access to the sale proceeds via distributions from the CRUT, while the CRUT may be eligible for its own $10 million exclusion. But since the CRUT pays only a fixed percentage each year, it will take time for those accumulated distributions to exceed the amount the couple would have amassed otherwise. How long? The answer depends on the trust term and payout percentage. DISPLAY 6: HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR THE CRUT TO PROVIDE A BENEFIT?

All portfolio income is assumed to be subject to top marginal federal tax rates. The values above do not reflect the assets inside the nongrantor trust. The 5-year CRUT is modeled with a payout of 37.5%, the 10-year CRUT is modeled with a payout of 20.9%, and the Life CRUT is modeled with a payout of 9.3%.

Section 1.664-1(d)(1) Bernstein Private Wealth Management 11If the CRUT qualifies as a separate taxpayer for QSBS purposes, we project that it will take roughly three years for a CRUT with a five- year term and a 37.5% unitrust payout to generate more personal wealth than our \u201cNo CRUT\u201d base case ( Display 6 ). By comparison, it would take 13 years for a joint-life CRUT with a unitrust payout of 9.3% to surpass the personal wealth generated in our base scenario. Interestingly, the Riveras end up with nearly the same amount of wealth in 30 years\u2014irrespective of the term\u2014and nearly $10 million more than not using the CRUT at all. Clearly, the CRUT creates more wealth if it captures an additional $10 million exclusion that will be paid out over time. Although CRUTs are typically designed to stretch the payouts to maximize tax deferral, the opposite may hold true for QSBS-funded CRUTs since there is no (or substantially lower) realized gain to be deferred. The Riveras aim to qualify the recipient trust as a separate taxpayer for QSBS purposes, while receiving $10 million of tax-free income as quickly as possible.A note of caution: If the CRUT fails to qualify for a separate QSBS exclusion\u2014or if future tax laws eliminate or reduce the QSBS benefit\u2014a longer noncharitable term generally will prove more protective of the Riveras\u2019 personal wealth. A needs-based analysis can help quantify the trade-offs, and thereby mitigate those risks. Entrepreneurs Have Options\u2014If They Know Where to Look Business owners have multiple tax-saving alternatives available to them in advance of a sale, but most strategies require considerable lead time to analyze and put into effect. The best advice for any business owner contemplating an eventual sale is to involve professional advisors early in the process. Once those advisors gain a better understanding of the owner\u2019s hopes and aspirations, they can build a custom plan that maximizes the proceeds of sale. Notes on the Bernstein Wealth Forecasting SystemSM 1. Purpose and Description of the Bernstein Wealth Forecasting System AB\u2019s Wealth Forecasting Analysis is designed to assist investors in making their long-term investment decisions as to their allocation of investments among categories of financial assets. Our planning tool consists of a four-step process: (1) Client-Profile Input: the client\u2019s asset allocation, income, expenses, cash withdrawals, tax rate, risk-tolerance level, goals and other factors; (2) Client Scenarios: in effect, questions the client would like our guidance on, which may touch on issues such as when to retire, what his/her cash-flow stream is likely to be, whether his/her portfolio can beat inflation long-term, and how different asset allocations might impact his/her long-term security; (3) The Capital-Markets Engine: our proprietary model that uses our research and historical data to create a vast range of hypothetical market returns, which takes into account the linkages within and among the capital markets, as well as their unpredictability; and finally (4) A Probability Distribution of Outcomes: based on the assets invested pursuant to the stated asset allocation, 90% of the estimated ranges of probable returns and asset values the client could experience are represented within the range established by the 5th and 95th percentiles on \u201cbox-and-whiskers\u201d graphs. However, outcomes outside this range are expected to occur 10% of the time; thus, the range does not guarantee results or establish the boundaries for all outcomes. Estimated market returns on bonds are derived taking into account yield and other criteria. An important assumption is that stocks will, over time, outperform long bonds by a reasonable amount, although this is in no way a certainty. Moreover, actual future results may not meet AB\u2019s estimates of the range of market returns, as these results are subject to a variety of economic, market and other variables. Accordingly, the analysis should not be construed as a promise of actual future results, the actual range of future results or the actual probability that these results will be realized. The information provided here is not intended for public use or distribution beyond our private meeting. Of course, no investment strategy or allocation can eliminate risk or guarantee returns. 2. Retirement Vehicles Each retirement plan is modeled as one of the following vehicles: Traditional IRA, 401(k), 403(b), Keogh, or Roth IRA/401(k). One of the significant differences among these vehicle types is the date at which mandatory distributions commence. For traditional IRA vehicles, mandatory distributions are assumed to commence during the year in which the investor reaches the age of 70.5. For 401(k), 403(b), and Keogh vehicles, mandatory distributions are assumed to commence at the later of (i) the year in which the investor reaches the age of 70.5 or (ii) the year in which the investor retires. In the case of a married couple, these dates are based on the date of birth of the older spouse. The minimum mandatory withdrawal is estimated using the Minimum Distribution Incidental Benefit tables as published on www.irs.gov. For Roth IRA/401(k) vehicles, there are no mandatory distributions. Distributions from Roth IRA/401(k) that exceed principal will be taxed and/or penalized if the distributed assets are less than five years old and the contributor is less than 59.5 years old. All Roth 401(k) plans will be rolled into a Roth IRA plan when the investor turns 59.5 years old to avoid Minimum Distribution requirements. Bernstein Private Wealth Management 12 3. Rebalancing Another important planning assumption is how the asset allocation varies over time. We attempt to model how the portfolio would actually be managed. Cash flows and cash generated from portfolio turnover are used to maintain the selected asset allocation between cash, bonds, stocks, REITs and hedge funds over the period of the analysis. Where this is not sufficient, an optimization program is run to trade off the mismatch between the actual allocation and targets against the cost of trading to rebalance. In general, the portfolio allocation will be maintained reasonably close to its target. In addition, in later years, there may be contention between the total relationship\u2019s allocation and those of the separate portfolios. For example, suppose an investor (in the top marginal federal tax bracket) begins with an asset mix consisting entirely of municipal bonds in his/her personal portfolio and entirely of stocks in his/her retirement portfolio. If personal assets are spent, the mix between stocks and bonds will be pulled away from targets. We put primary weight on maintaining the overall allocation near target, which may result in an allocation to taxable bonds in the retirement portfolio as the personal assets decrease in value relative to the retirement portfolio\u2019s value. 4. Expenses and Spending Plans (Withdrawals) All results are generally shown after applicable taxes and after anticipated withdrawals and/or additions, unless otherwise noted. Liquidations may result in realized gains or losses, which will have capital-gains tax implications. 5. Modeled Asset Classes The following assets or indexes were used in this analysis to represent the various model classes: Asset Class Modeled as: Annual Turnover Rate Municipal Cash Municipal money-market securities 100% Cash Equivalents 3-month Treasury bills 100% Intermediate-Term Diversified Municipals AA-rated diversified municipal bonds of 7-year maturity 30% Intermediate-Term Taxables Taxable bonds with maturity of 7 years 30% US Diversified S&P 500 Index 15% US Value S&P/Barra Value Index 15% US Growth S&P/Barra Growth Index 15% US Low Vol Equity MSCI US Minimum Volatility Index 15% Developed International MSCI EAFE Unhedged 15% Emerging Markets MSCI Emerging Markets Index 20% US SMID Russell 2500 15% High-Risk Intl Country Fund 15% Global Intermediate Taxable Bonds Hedged 7-year 50% Sovereign and 50% Investment Grade Corporate Debt of Developed Countries30% 6. Volatility Volatility is a measure of dispersion of expected returns around the average. The greater the volatility, the more likely it is that returns in any one period will be substantially above or below the expected result. The volatility for each asset class used in this analysis is listed on the Capital-Market Projections page at the end of these Notes. In general, two-thirds of the returns will be within one standard deviation. For example, assuming that stocks are expected to return 8.0% on a compounded basis and the volatility of returns on stocks is 17.0%, in any one year it is likely that two-thirds of the projected returns will be between (8.9)% and 28.8%. With intermediate government bonds, if the expected compound return is assumed to be 5.0% and the volatility is assumed to be 6.0%, two-thirds of the outcomes will typically be between (1.1)% and 1 1.5%. AB\u2019s forecast of volatility is based on historical data and incorporates AB\u2019s judgment that the volatility of fixed-income assets is different for different time periods. 7. Technical Assumptions AB\u2019s Wealth Forecasting System is based on a number of technical assumptions regarding the future behavior of financial markets. AB\u2019s Capital Markets Engine is the module responsible for creating simulations of returns in the capital markets. These simulations are based on inputs that summarize the current condition of the capital markets as of December 31, 2020. Therefore, the first 12-month period of simulated returns represents the period from December 31, 2020, through December 31, 2021, and not necessarily the calendar year of 2020. A description of these technical assumptions is available on request.

In considering this material, you should discuss your individual circumstances with professionals in those areas before making any decisions. 9. Tax Rates The federal income tax rate represents AB\u2019s estimate of either the top marginal tax bracket or an \u201caverage\u201d rate calculated based upon the marginal rate schedule. The federal capital gains tax rate is represented by the lesser of the top marginal income tax bracket or the current cap on capital gains for an individual or corporation, as applicable. Federal tax rates are blended with applicable state tax rates by including, among other things, federal deductions for state income and capital gains taxes. The state income tax rate represents AB\u2019s estimate of the \u201caverage\u201d rate calculated based upon the applicable state\u2019s marginal tax schedule. Where an applicable state tax code permits the exclusion of a portion of capital gain income from gross income for purposes of calculating state income tax such exclusions have been included in the calculation. 10. Intentionally Defective Grantor Trusts (IDGTs) The Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust (IDGT) is modeled as an irrevocable trust whose assets are treated as the grantor\u2019s for income tax purposes, but not for gift or estate tax purposes. Some income and transfer-tax consequences associated with transfers to and the operation of an IDGT remain uncertain, and the strategy may be subject to challenge by the IRS. Hence, this technique requires substantial guidance from tax and legal advisors. The grantor may give assets to the trust, which will require using gift tax exemptions or exclusions, or paying gift taxes. The IDGT is modeled with one or more current beneficiaries, and one or more remainder beneficiaries. Distributions to the current beneficiaries are not required, but the system permits the user to structure annual distributions in a number of different ways, including 1) an amount or a percentage of fiduciary accounting income (FAI) (which may be defined to include some or all realized capital gains); 2) FAI plus some principal, expressed either as a percentage of trust assets or as a dollar amount; 3) an annuity, or fixed-dollar amount, which may be increased annually by inflation, or by a fixed percentage; 4) a unitrust, or annual payment of a percentage of trust assets, based on the trust\u2019s value at the beginning of the year, or average over multiple years; or 5) any combination of the above four payout methods. Because the IDGT is modeled as a grantor trust, the system calculates all taxes on income and realized capital gains that occur in the IDGT portfolio each year, based on the grantor\u2019s tax rates and other income, and pays them from the grantor\u2019s personal portfolio. The IDGT may continue for the duration of the analysis, or the trust assets may be distributed in cash or in kind at a specific point in time or periodically to (1) a non-modeled recipient, (2) a taxable trust, or (3) a taxable portfolio for someone other than the grantor. If applicable, an installment sale to an IDGT may be modeled as a user-entered initial \u201cseed\u201d gift followed by a sale of additional assets to the trust. The system will use one of two methods to repay the value of the sale assets plus interest (less any user-specified discount to the grantor): 1) user-defined payback schedule, or 2) annual interest-only payments at the applicable federal rate (AFR) appropriate for the month of sale and the term of the installment note, with a balloon payment of principal plus any unpaid interest at the end of the specified term."}

EisnerAmper 2020 Personal T ax Guide6 RETURN TO TOCT ax planning strategies can defer some of your current year\u2019s tax liability to a future year, thereby freeing up cash for investment, business, or personal use. This can be accomplished by timing when certain expenses are paid, or controlling when income is recognized. T ax planning allows you to take advantage of tax rate differentials between years. However, if tax rates rise in a subsequent year, extra caution may be necessary. As a result of the T ax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u201cTCJA \u201d), the alternative minimum tax (\u201c AMT\u201d) will likely affect less taxpayers than in past years, so some of the tax strategies utilized in prior years will no longer be applicable. The key factors you should consider when identifying strategies to minimize your taxes are: \u2022 Prior to 2018, while residents of states with high income and property taxes (such as New York, California, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and New Jersey) were able to deduct the full amount of state income and property taxes against federal taxable income, they most likely did not receive a benefit if they were subject to the AMT. Beginning after December 31, 2017, state income and property tax deductions are limited to $10,000 and the deduction continues to be subject to the AMT. It is now less likely that the AMT will apply to many taxpayers. \u2022 In addition to the limitations on state income and property taxes, miscellaneous itemized deductions such as investment expenses, unreimbursed business expenses, and professional fees are no longer deductible. Residents of New York will still be able to deduct real estate taxes and miscellaneous itemized deductions on their NYS income tax returns, though they may be limited based on their adjusted gross income (\u201c AGI\u201d). Also, exemptions are completely repealed and instead have been consolidated into the standard deduction. \u2022 The current top long-term capital gains tax rate is 20%. Including the additional 3.8% Medicare Contribution T ax on net investment income, the top federal long-term capital gains rate could be 23.8% | Tax Planning Goals Proper tax planning can achieve the following goals: \u2022 Reduce the current year\u2019s tax liability. \u2022 Defer the current year\u2019s tax liability to future years, thereby increasing availability of cash for investment, business, or personal needs. \u2022 Reduce any potential future years\u2019 tax liabilities. \u2022 Maximize the tax savings from allowable deductions. \u2022 Minimize the effect of the AMT on this year\u2019s tax liability. \u2022 Maximize tax savings by taking advantage of available tax credits. \u2022 Maximize the amount of wealth that stays in your family. \u2022 Minimize capital gains tax. \u2022 Minimize the Medicare Contribution T ax on net investment income. \u2022 Avoid penalties for underpayment of estimated taxes. \u2022 Manage your cash flow by projecting when tax payments will be required. \u2022 Minimize potential future estate taxes to maximize the amount left to your beneficiaries and/or charities (rather than the government). \u2022 Maximize the amount of money you will have available to fund your children\u2019s education as well as your retirement. and the top federal short-term capital gains tax rate could be as much as 40.8% in 2019 and 2020. \u2022 Under the TCJA, taxpayers may defer tax on prior short-term and/or long-term capital gains if the amount of the gain is invested in a qualified opportunity fund. Investors can reinvest their capital gains into areas that need investment (qualified opportunity zones). Gains can come from any T ax Planning Strategies7 RETURN TO TOCinvestment, whether that is from stocks, bonds, real estate or partnership interests. T o qualify for certain tax breaks, investors must invest their capital gains in a qualified opportunity fund within 180 days of realizing those gains. The money cannot be invested directly into a property, and funds must invest 90% of their capital into opportunity zone properties. For gains realized from flow-through entities, the date realized is deemed to be December 31 (or the year-end of the entity if a fiscal year). \u2022 Under current law, the complex netting rules have the potential effect of making your long-term capital gains subject to short-term rates, so you must carefully time your security trades to ensure that you receive the full benefit of the lowest capital gains tax rate. \u2022 Gift and estate taxes can reduce the amount your beneficiaries will receive by 40% to 50%, depending on which state one is a resident of at date of death. However, there are planning techniques and strategies available to maximize the amount of wealth that is preserved for your family. | Year-End Tax Planning Tips T ax Tip 1 provides a snapshot of key strategies geared toward helping you achieve your planning goals. It includes ideas to help you reduce your current year\u2019s tax as well as any potential future taxes. While this chart is not all inclusive, it is a good starting point to help you identify planning ideas that might apply to your situation. Keep in mind that many of the strategies involve knowing what your approximate income, expenses and tax rates will be for the current and subsequent years and then applying the applicable tax law for each year to determine the best path to follow. Implementation of many of these ideas requires a thorough knowledge of tax laws, thoughtful planning and timely action. Timing when you pay deductible expenses and when you receive income (to the extent you have control) can reduce your taxes. Timing expenses and income can also defer some of your tax liability to next year (or even later years) giving you, rather than the government, use of your money. T o gain the maximum benefit, you need to project, as best you can, your tax situation for the current and subsequent years. This will help you identify your tax bracket for each year. Your year-to-date realized long- and short-term capital gains and losses should be included in your projections. Be sure to consider prior- year loss carryforwards (if any). Based on these results, you can decide what steps to take prior to year-end. You will be able to decide whether or not you should prepay deductions and defer income, defer expenses and accelerate income, realize capital losses, or lock in capital gains. T ax Tip 2 offers basic guidance for deciding when to prepay or defer deductible expenses and when to defer or collect taxable income. T ax Tip 3 offers steps to follow relating to realized capital gains and/or losses, and the type of gains and losses you should trigger. | Expenses You Can Prepay Here are the most common deductible expenses you can easily prepay by December 31, if appropriate: Charitable Contributions You can deduct charitable gifts of cash up to 60% of your AGI, tangible personal property, such as clothing and household goods, up to 50% of your AGI and charitable gifts of appreciated capital gain properties up to 30% of your AGI. These percentages apply to gifts made to public charities. Be sure to work through the calculations though, as gifting different types of property to charities with varying exempt status (such as private foundations), can limit the amount of the deduction allowed in a particular year.

Cash Salaries or Bonuses If you anticipate your current year\u2019s income tax rate to be lower than next year\u2019s rate, you can accelerate salary or bonuses into the current year. You would need to determine if there are strict limitations on amounts that can be accelerated. However, if next year\u2019s rate is lower than your current year\u2019s rate, it may make sense to defer such income until next year provided the $10,000 ($5,000 for married filing separately) for the aggregate of (1) state and local income taxes and (2) state and local property taxes paid. Miscellaneous Itemized Deductions All miscellaneous itemized deductions that are subject to the limitation of 2% of AGI will be suspended until years beginning after December 31, 2025. Mortgage Interest Before the end of 2020, consider prepaying your mortgage payment for next January in the current year in order to accelerate the deduction. Margin Interest Before the end of 2020, be sure to pay any margin interest before December 31, since interest accrued at year-end is only deductible if actually paid. This may also reduce the Medicare Contribution T ax on net investment income. Business Equipment Before the end of 2020, accelerate the purchases of 2. AMT Tax Planning StrategiesTax Tip T ax Planning Strategies11 RETURN TO TOCincome is not constructively received (made available to you in the current year). Consulting or Other Self-Employment Income If you are a cash-basis business and you anticipate your current year\u2019s tax rate to be lower than next year\u2019s rate, you can accelerate income into the current year. Otherwise, you would want to defer such income. Retirement Plan Distributions If you are over age 59\u00bd and your tax rate is low this year, you may consider taking a taxable distribution from your retirement plan even if it is not required, or consider a Roth IRA conversion. Individuals of at least age 70\u00bd are allowed to make tax-free distributions of up to $100,000 from individual retirement accounts (\u201cIRAs\u201d) to public charities. This allows an individual to exclude the distribution from income; thereby reducing your state income taxes in states that limit or disallow the charitable contribution deduction. Capital Gains The following ideas can lower your taxes this year: \u2022 If you have unrealized net short-term capital gains, consider selling the positions and realize the gains in the current year if you expect next year\u2019s tax rate to be higher. Only consider this strategy if you do not otherwise intend to hold the position for more than 12 months, making it eligible for the long-term capital gain rate of 20%, exclusive of the additional Medicare Contribution T ax. However, you may be able to apply the netting rule which may result in the offsetting of long-term losses to short-term gains, resulting in a tax savings of 37% in 2020 rather than 20%. \u2022 Considering investing in a qualified opportunity fund. \u2022 Review your portfolio to determine if you have any securities that you may be able to claim as worthless, thereby giving you a capital loss before the end of the year. A similar rule applies to bad debts. \u2022 Avoid wash sales. Loss recognition is disallowed if the same or substantially identical security is purchased 30 days before or after the sale of the security that created the loss. \u2022 Consider a bond swap to realize losses in your bond portfolio. This swap allows you to purchase similar bonds and avoid the wash sale rule while maintaining your overall bond positions. Note: If you are married filing separately, substitute $1,500 for $3,000 in the above tip. If you have Consider taking these st eps Both short-term and long-term losses Sell securities to r ecognize unrealized gains, preferably if held short-term, up to the amount of your losses, less $3,000. Long-term gains in excess of short-term losses T ake losses equal to the net gain, plus $3,000. Use long-term loss positions first, then short-term loss positions. Both short-term and long-term gains, or T ake losses equal to the net gain, plus $3,000. Use long-term loss positions short-term gains in excess of long-term losses fir st to gain the benefit of offsetting short-term gains (taxed at a rate as high as 37% in 2020 plus 3.8% Medicar e Contribution T ax on net investment income). Worthless securities and bad debts Identif y these securities and debts and take the necessary steps to ensure that the losses are deductible in the current year, by having the proper substantiation.3. Year-End Capital Gains and LossesTax Tip EisnerAmper 2020 Personal T ax Guide12 RETURN TO TOC\u2022 Similarly, you may consider selling securities this year to realize long-term capital gains that may be taxed at the more favorable rate this year, and then buying them back to effectively gain a step-up in basis. Since the sales are at a gain, the wash sale rules do not apply. Real Estate and Other Non-Publicly Traded Property Sales If you are selling real estate or other non-publicly traded property at a gain, you would normally structure the terms of the arrangement so that most of the payments would be due next year. You can use the installment sale method to report the income. This would allow you to recognize only a portion of the taxable gain in the current year to the extent of the payments you received, thereby allowing you to defer much of that tax to future years. U.S. Treasury Bill Income If you have U.S. Treasury Bills maturing early next year, you may want to sell these bills to recognize income in the current year if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket this year than next year. | Bunching Deductions Medical ExpensesAs a result of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, the 7.5% of AGI threshold has been retained for 2019 and 2020. Thereafter, the threshold will revert to 10% of AGI.Therefore, bunching unreimbursed medical expenses into a single year could result in a tax benefit. Medical expenses include health insurance and dental care. If you are paying a private nurse or a nursing home for a parent or other relative, you can take these expenses on your tax return even if you do not claim the parent or relative as your dependent, assuming you meet certain eligibility requirements.Charitable Contributions As a result of the TCJA, many itemized deductions have been eliminated or limited. The deduction for the charitable contribution is the exception, as it has virtually been untouched by the new law. At the same time, the standard deduction has increased substantially. An individual can deduct the larger of either his/her standard deduction or itemized deductions. Thus, in order to maximize the deduction for charitable contributions, it might be best to bunch gifts to charities in one year, so the individual\u2019s charitable contributions exceed the standard deduction amounts, and he or she will be able to itemize. Similarly, funding a donor-advised fund, private foundation or a charitable trust in a particular year may be effective in maximizing the tax benefit of such charitable deductions. | Ad just Year-End Withholding or Make Estimated Tax Payments If you expect to be subject to an underpayment penalty for failure to pay your current-year tax liability on a timely basis, consider increasing your withholding and/ or make an estimated tax payment between now and the end of the year in order to eliminate or minimize the amount of the penalty. | Utilize Business Losses or Take Tax-Free Distributions It may be possible to deduct losses that would otherwise be limited by your tax basis or the \u201cat risk\u201d rules. Or, you may be able to take tax-free distributions from a partnership, limited liability company (\u201cLLC\u201d) or S corporation if you have tax basis in the entity and have already been taxed on the income. If there is a basis limitation, consider contributing capital to the entity or making a loan under certain conditions. See further discussion in the chapter on business owner issues and depreciation deductions. T ax Planning Strategies13 RETURN TO TOC| P assive Losses If you have passive losses from a business in which you do not materially participate that are in excess of your income from these types of activities, consider disposing of the activity. The tax savings can be significant since all losses become deductible when you dispose of the activity. Even if there is a gain on the disposition, you can receive the benefit of having the long-term capital gain taxed at 23.8% (28.8% if the gain is subject to depreciation recapture) inclusive of the Medicare Contribution T ax with all the previously suspended losses offsetting ordinary income at a potential tax benefit of 40.8% in 2020 inclusive of the Medicare Contribution T ax. | I ncentive Stock Options Review your incentive stock option plans (\u201cISOs\u201d) prior to year-end. A poorly timed exercise of ISOs can be very costly since the spread between the fair market value of the stock and your exercise price is a tax preference item for AMT purposes. If you are in the AMT, you will have to pay a tax on that spread, generally at 28%. If you expect to be in the AMT this year but do not project to be next year, you should defer the exercise. Conversely, if you are not in the AMT this year, you should consider accelerating the exercise of the options; however, keep in mind to not exercise so much as to be subject to the AMT. | Estat e Planning If you have not already done so, consider making your annual exclusion gifts to your beneficiaries before the end of the year. You are allowed to make tax-free gifts of up to $15,000 per year, per individual ($30,000 if you are married and use a gift-splitting election, or $15,000 from each spouse if the gift is funded from his and her own separate accounts). By making these gifts, you can transfer substantial amounts out of your estate without using any of your lifetime exclusion. Also, try to make these gifts early in the year to transfer that year\u2019s appreciation out of your estate. Furthermore, because of the increased cumulative lifetime gift exclusion in 2020, you may wish to make additional gifts to fully utilize such exclusion of $11.58 million ($23.16 million for married couples). The lifetime gift exclusion has doubled as a result of the TCJA; however, it will sunset at the end of 2025 reverting back to the maximum lifetime gift exclusion in effect before the TCJA became law. When combined with other estate and gift planning techniques such as a grantor retained annuity trust, tax planning strategies may enable you to avoid estate and gift taxes and transfer a great deal of wealth to other family members (who may be in a lower income tax bracket or may need financial assistance). Note: The amount of the lifetime gift exclusion will be adjusted annually for the chained CPI. | T ax Strategies for Business Owners Timing of Income and Deductions If you are a cash-basis business and expect your current year\u2019s tax rate to be higher than next year\u2019s rate, you can delay billing until January of next year for services already performed in order to take advantage of the lower tax rate next year. Similarly, even if you expect next year\u2019s rate to be the same as this year\u2019s rate, you should still delay billing until after year-end to defer the tax to next year. You also have the option to prepay or defer paying business expenses in order to realize the deduction in the year that you expect to be subject to the higher tax rate. This can be particularly significant if you are considering purchasing (and placing in service) business equipment. If you are concerned about your cash flow and want to accelerate your deductions, you can charge the purchases on the company\u2019s credit card. This will allow you to take the deduction in the current year when the charge is made, even though you may EisnerAmper 2020 Personal T ax Guide14 RETURN TO TOCnot actually pay the outstanding credit card bill until after December 31. Business Equipment T ax benefits are available for immediate deduction of business equipment purchased and placed in service in 2020. The amount allowable for full deduction in 2020 under IRC Sec. 179 is $1,000,000 if property placed in service does not exceed $2,590,000. After reaching this threshold, the deduction is phased out, dollar-for-dollar, up to $3,590,000. Bonus depreciation was increased to 100% for property placed in service after September 27, 2017. The allowable bonus percentage decreases by 20% each year, beginning in 2023 with 2026 being the last year at 20% bonus. The TCJA expands the definition of qualified property to include used property (as long as the taxpayer did not use the property prior to the purchase). Note: Under the TCJA, some businesses may not be eligible for the bonus depreciation. For example, bonus depreciation is not allowed for businesses with annual gross receipts of more than $25 million for the prior three years and real estate businesses that elect to deduct 100% of their business interest expenses. Note: The bonus depreciation is an addback on most state returns while IRC Sec. 179 expense is only a partial addback. Business Interest If you have debt that can be traced to your business expenditures \u2013 including debt used to finance the capital requirements of a partnership, S corporation or LLC involved in a trade or business in which you materially participate \u2013 you can deduct the interest \u201cabove-the-line\u201d as business interest rather than as an itemized deduction. The interest is a direct reduction of the income from the business. This allows you to deduct all of your business interest, even if you are a resident of a state that limits or disallows all of your itemized deductions.Business interest also includes finance charges on items that you purchase for your business (as an owner) using the company\u2019s credit card. These purchases are treated as additional loans to the business, subject to tracing rules that allow you to deduct the portion of the finance charges that relate to the business items purchased. Credit card purchases made before year-end and paid for in 2021 are allowable deductions in 2020 for cash basis businesses. Note: Interest expense deduction is limited to 30% of adjusted taxable income (\u201cATI\u201d). Such limitation does not apply to: \u2022 Businesses with average gross receipt that do not exceed $25 million \u2022 Electing real property trade or business Qualified Business Income Deduction Qualified business income (\u201cQBI\u201d) is generally defined as net income and deductions that are effectively connected to a U.S. business. Through 2025, the TCJA provides an IRC Sec. 199A deduction for sole proprietors and owners of pass-through entities of a \u201cqualified\u201d business generally equal to 20% of qualified business income, subject to various loss and deduction limitation. Though this deduction is not allowed in calculating the owner\u2019s AGI, it does reduce the taxable income. Excess Business Losses and Net Operating Losses Excess losses from all of your trades or businesses are limited to $510,000 (married filing jointly) and $255,000 (all others). Any losses above these amounts will be carried forward as a net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d). Beginning in tax years after December 31, 2017, NOLs can no longer be carried back. NOLs can be used to offset 80% of taxable income in future years with any excess to be carried forward indefinitely."}

What you do during the year may affect any tax you could owe or refund you may expect next year. Check your tax withholding throughout the year Since federal taxes operate on a pay-as-you-go basis, you need to pay most of your tax during the year as you earn income. If you don\u2019t pay your tax through withholding, or don\u2019t pay enough tax that way, you might have to pay estimated tax. It\u2019s a good idea to make sure you\u2019re not having too little tax withheld, which could lead to a smaller than expected refund or even a tax bill. Or, you may want to check that you aren\u2019t having too much tax withheld, if having that extra money in each paycheck is more helpful than getting a larger refund when you file. Use the IRS Tax Withholding Estimator to check your withholding when personal or financial information changes occur due to a life event, like getting married or divorced , having a baby or getting a raise at work. You\u2019ll need to give your employer an updated Form W-4 to change how much tax is withheld from your paycheck. Some taxpayers earn income not subject to withholding. Small business owners and self-employed people\u2014including gig economy workers\u2014may need to make quarterly estimated tax payments . Organize your tax records Develop a recordkeeping system\u2014electronic or paper\u2014that keeps your important information together. Add tax records to the files as you receive them. This includes year-end Forms W-2 from employers, Forms 1099 from banks and other payers, other income documents and records of virtual currency transactions. Having records organized makes preparing a tax return easier. It may also help you discover potentially overlooked deductions or credits.

To learn more about managing your taxes after a life event, visit IRS.gov/lifeevents . Know how Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) affects your taxes Your AGI and tax rate are important factors in figuring your taxes. AGI is your income from all sources minus any adjustments or deductions to your income. Generally, the higher the AGI, the higher the tax rate, and the more tax you pay. Tax planning can include making changes during the year that can lower your AGI. There are several ways to reduce your AGI, including contributing to a retirement account or Health Savings Account , claiming educator expenses if you\u2019re a qualifying educator, and paying student loan interest . Be prepared to claim tax credits and deductions Taxable income is what\u2019s left over after you subtract any eligible deductions , including your standard deduction , from your AGI. Most people take the standard deduction, but some may choose to itemize deductions because it could lower their taxable income even more. As a general rule, if your itemized deductions are greater than the standard deduction, you should itemize. Use the Interactive Tax Assistant to see whether itemizing is right for you. YEAR-ROUND TAX PLANNING IS FOR EVERYONE Maximize your tax refund You may qualify for tax credits, like the Earned Income Tax Credit , Child and Dependent Care Credit , Child Tax Credit and the Credit for Other Dependents .
